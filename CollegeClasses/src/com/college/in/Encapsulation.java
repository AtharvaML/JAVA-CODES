// in encapsulation for providing security to the important data members we declares the data member as private 
// the private member of class is accessible from with in the same class so private prevent complete access but encapsulation is not prevent complete access rather it provides controlled 
// controlled access is provided by using public setter and public getter. this setter and getter must contain validation code in order to provide complete access  
// since setter and getter are public it can be access from outside the class also this setter and getter method with the same class as the private member
